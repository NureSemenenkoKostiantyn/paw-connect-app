## 🛠️ Project Status

- 🔧 Active Development *(MVP phase)*
- 🎯 Main focus: mobile app + RESTful backend

## WebSocket API

The backend exposes a STOMP endpoint at `/ws-chat`. The handshake requires a valid JWT,
so include the token in the `Authorization` header (or cookie) when connecting
with a WebSocket or SockJS client. Each message is sent on behalf of the authenticated
`Principal` from the WebSocket session. The controller places that authentication into
the `SecurityContext` before saving the message so that regular service-layer security
checks continue to work.

### Endpoints

- Chats are automatically created when two users match.
- `/app/chat.send` – send a message to a chat; messages appear on `/topic/chats/{chatId}`.
- `GET /api/chats/{chatId}/messages` – retrieve chat history paged by `page` and `limit`.

### REST Endpoints

- `GET /api/chats` – list chats for the current user. Each item is a `ChatResponse`.

`ChatResponse` fields:

- `id` – chat ID.
- `type` – `PRIVATE` or `GROUP`.
- `eventId` – associated event ID if the chat is for an event.
- `participantIds` – user IDs participating in the chat.
- `lastMessage` – details of the most recent message (or `null`).
- `unreadCount` – number of unread messages for the requesting user.
